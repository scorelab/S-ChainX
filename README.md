# S-ChainX
In commerce, supply chain management, the management of the flow of goods and services, involves the movement and storage of raw materials, of work-in-process inventory, and of finished goods from point of origin to point of consumption. A consumer being able to keep track of these intermediate steps at any given point ensures the superiority and the freshness of the product he/she is about to consume. S-ChainX is an open source platform, in which the organizations can define their subsequent procedures that take place in their supply chains. The agent will be inserting the corresponding details to the platform and on the other hand, the consumers will be able to view the stored information. To make sure that the consumers get accurate data and that the data can not be manipulated, S-ChainX uses blockchain to store the transactions.
